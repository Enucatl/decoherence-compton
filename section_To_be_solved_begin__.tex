\section{To be solved}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compton scattered photons do not enter the detector after a typical collision, so that this effect should be strongly suppressed. The measured signal is in fact twice as strong as the absorption. Moreover, why does the ratio of dark field and transmission have the same value for all materials?
\item The treatment of decoherence above works for particles with a large mass. Do photons work similarly?
\end{enumerate}
